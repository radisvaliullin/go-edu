The Go-Edu is texts, links, examples, playground to help to learn the Go/Golang.

Hi Everyone! This is a repo to help people to learn Golang. It is based on my experience of learning the Go. I've been learning Go as a second language since 2016. If Golang is your first programming language maybe you need to start first from sources explaining basics of programming in general.

Go is a simple language by design. There are many mythologies about Go like "Go is a poor/simple language because it was invented by engineers from the 70s/80s who don't know modern things". I guess it is just another myth of IT. To get right understanding things/ideas behind of design of Golang read article by Go author Rob Pike (["Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering"](https://go.dev/talks/2012/splash.article), this article location was changed several times, original version was based on "talk given by Rob Pike at the SPLASH 2012 conference in Tucson, Arizona, on October 25, 2012"). It explains a lot of things.
